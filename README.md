# Ìøì Pong Game

A Python-based recreation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics module. This project helped me sharpen my **logical thinking**, improve my grasp of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and refine my ability to structure interactive applications.

## ÌæÆ Game Features

- ÌµπÔ∏è Two-player paddle control
- Ì∑† Ball movement with realistic bounce logic
- Ì∑± Collision detection with paddles and walls
- Ì∑æ Score tracking and display
- Ì¥Å Game reset and replay functionality
- Ì∑© Modular code design using classes

## Ì∑† What I Learned

Building this game was a major step forward in my programming journey. I explored and improved:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Designed classes for paddles, ball, and scoreboard
- **Logical Thinking**: Implemented collision logic and movement patterns
- **Event Handling**: Used `onkeypress()` for responsive controls
- **Code Organization**: Broke down functionality into clean, reusable components
- **Debugging Skills**: Troubleshot edge cases and refined gameplay mechanics
